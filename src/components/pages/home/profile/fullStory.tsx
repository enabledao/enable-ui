      <p>
        I studied Industrial Engineering at Institut Teknologi Bandung, ranked
        #1out of 3,000 universities in Indonesia. I graduated circa 2009 and
        have been pursuing my career in Human Resources ever since. I am also
        the first generation in my family to get a bachelor degree. I have over
        9 years of cross-industry experience in HR. For 3 years, I was the Head
        of HR for Freudenberg Household Products, a $9 billion German company
        operating in Indonesia and Malaysia. I was the founding members of one
        of the biggest P2P-lending companies in Indonesia called Amartha. I
        oversaw this business spread across Indonesia with over 200+ branches
        and more than 1000 employees. I also have experience leading smaller
        organizations of around 150 employees in the technology industry, where
        I intend to deepen my work. Getting accepted to Cornell University means
        the world to me. Not only that it will take me one step closer to
        achieving my longtime goal: to be a prominent and competent female
        leader figure, but also to close the gender gap in Indonesia. As a woman
        born into working-class family, raised in a third-world country with
        strong patriarchal culture, and working in male-dominated industries, I
        can prove that if I can break the glass ceiling and pursue my long-time
        goal with limited resources and opportunities, then all women from
        Indonesia can do it too. Over the last 4 years of my career, women
        empowerment and youth development have been my focus. I have been giving
        career and skill development counseling to young women in Indonesia to
        strive their professional life in my spare time. I was one of the
        speakers at Dana Cita Inspiring Forum, an educational workshop in 5 big
        cities in Indonesia. I shared my take on professional life after
        graduation and industrial revolution 4.0 preparation with college
        graduates. I coach interns to apply for jobs; from resume writing, self
        branding to interview practice. I also help and mentor young women in
        casual setting regularly. I am persistent and do not intend to stop
        doing this, regardless of whether I can afford Cornell. Of course, if I
        do go to Cornell I will be in a better position to unlock the potential
        of Indonesiaâ€™s women by sharing knowledge, being a mentor, and opening
        doors for them on an international stage.
